            //but effectively have infinite inertia and do not respond to collisions or forces.

            //************************
            //There are a variety of ways to construct entities depending on your needs.
            //The most common approach is to use the 'prefab' types, like the Box, Sphere, ConvexHull, Cylinder, and so on (BEPUphysics.Entities.Prefabs namespace).
            //These provide a short cut to constructing the objects and generally provide convenience accessors to shape properties.

            //We'll start with such an entity for the kinematic ground.  Notice how it allows the definition of position and shape data all in the constructor.
            //It has other overloads that allow you to specify a mass (for a dynamic object) or a full MotionState instead of just a position.
            Box ground = new Box(new Vector3(0, -.5f, 0), 50, 1, 50);
            Space.Add(ground);

            //If you examine the ground's CollisionInformation property, you'll find that it is a generic method which returns a ConvexCollidable<BoxShape>.
            //So, in addition to having convenience properties, it also lets you go deeper into the object's data by knowing what the types are.


            //************************
            //Let's go one level up the hierarchy to Entity<T>.  This is the superclass of all prefab types.
            //The generic parameter is the type of the Collidable that the entity uses as its collision proxy.
            //It is also what allows prefab types' CollisionInformation property to return that type rather than EntityCollidable.

            Space.Add(new Entity<ConvexCollidable<SphereShape>>(new ConvexCollidable<SphereShape>(new SphereShape(1)), 1)

            //That's a bit unwieldy<<>><>, but it works.  Directly constructing entities in this manner isn't common or generally necessary.
            //If you want to have a CollisionInformation property that returns a specific type but don't want to use a specific prefab type, this is the way to go.

            //Note that the constructor itself does not include any position/motion state parameters nor does it include any direct shape data.  The position and other auxiliary
            //properties can be set after it's been constructed.  In this case, object initializer syntax is used to set the Position.
            //The shape data is included within the first EntityCollidable parameter which defines the entity's collision proxy.
            //The prefab types discussed previously all create such EntityCollidables internally using the data passed into the constructor.


            //************************
            //So let's move onto something a little more convenient.  Entity<T> has a non-generic parent Entity.  It still has a CollisionInformation property,
            //but it returns an EntityCollidable rather than a specific type.

                });

            //Much better! No more ugly generic type syntax pollution.  Notice that there are quite a few overloads in the Entity.
            //In addition to overloads that accept EntityCollidable instances (as used in the generic entity above), Entity provides constructors that
            //take shapes directly.  Internally, the entity can create its own EntityCollidable instance based on the shape.  This further simplifies the construction process.

            //An object initializer is once again used to set the position, since the constructors do not have all the convenience constructor frills of the prefab types.


            //************************
            //All of the above entity types have read-only CollisionInformation properties.  Once an entity of those types is created, it cannot change its fundamental shape.
            //A sphere may get bigger or smaller, but a sphere entity couldn't become a box entity.

            morphable.CollisionInformation = new ConvexCollidable<ConeShape>(new ConeShape(2, 1));

            //That's neat, but that collidable constructor with generic type is a bit ugly.  We don't care about doing any type-specific configuration
            //on the EntityCollidable itself, so we can just tell the shape to make us an EntityCollidable instance.  This is what the Entity/MorphableEntity constructors
            //do internally when given an EntityShape instead of an EntityCollidable (which in turn contains an EntityShape).
            morphable.CollisionInformation = new ConeShape(2, 1).GetCollidableInstance();

            //While this is arguably a bit prettier, its major benefit comes from the fact that you don't need to know the type of the shape to call GetCollidableInstance.
            //If it's an EntityShape, it can create an EntityCollidable for itself.



            //************************
            //That's it for the different types of entities.  Another very useful technique is to share shapes and initialization between entities.
            //Re-using convex hulls is a common use case.  They have a fairly expensive initialization, and they tend to be some of the larger shapes memory-wise.
            //Rather than having a thousand redundant copies of identical geometry, one shape can be made and reused for subsequent entities.

            //In older versions, initializing the entity was a little expensive if the inertia tensor and some other data wasn't provided.
            //These days, the cost is done once in the shape and the entity initialization is pretty much always super cheap.
            //So, you don't need to share inertia tensors for performance reasons.

            //************************
            //All convex shapes are centered on their local origin.  If you create a box entity and assign its position to (0,1,0), the box shape's center will end up at (0,1,0).

            //So now it's centered on the local origin, as was needed.  But there's a problem- what if you wanted your convex hull entity to end up at the original vertex positions?
            //To get it there, we need to know the offset from the original vertices to the local vertices.
            //Fortunately, there is a constructor overload which provides it!
