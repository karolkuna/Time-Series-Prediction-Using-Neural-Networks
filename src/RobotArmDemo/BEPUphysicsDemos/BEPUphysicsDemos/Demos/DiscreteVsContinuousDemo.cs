    /// Demonstrates the difference between discrete collision detection and continuous collision detection.
    /// The default position update mode for objects is Discrete, which means they blindly move forward 
    /// based on their velocities every frame.  Continuous mode objects perform a sweep test based on the
    /// frame's motion, preventing the object from moving past a collision that would have otherwise significantly
    /// altered its trajectory.
    /// 
    /// When a continuous object hits a moving discrete object, the discrete object will still move all the way
    /// through its frame's motion and the continuous object will sweep against the discrete's final position.
    /// 
    /// There's a third update mode called "Passive," which is a midpoint between Discrete and Continuous.
    /// A discrete object won't perform sweep tests by itself, but it will listen to sweep tests requested by other
    /// Continuous objects.  The passive object will then only move up to the first point of contact, rather than 
    /// all the way through its frame's motion like a Discrete would.
    /// 
    /// The default mode that entities use can be changed in the MotionSettings.DefaultPositionUpdateMode field.
